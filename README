ENTITY ENGINE V4
*********************

Welcome to Entity Engine V4, a free, open-source, entity-component framework.

You can view the project on github: https://github.com/redcodefinal/EntityEngineV4
and it's test project here: https://github.com/redcodefinal/EntityEngineV4TestBed

This project is aimed at making XNA to be a little easier to make games with. The goal is the provide
a full set of tools to work with XNA and EE, however, since EE is constantly changing, it'll be hard to lock
down those tools in the short term. 

Thank you for downloading and please don't judge too harshly, I'm a full-time student doing this in my free
time with self-taught programming knowledge.
